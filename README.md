# GrabAStar Frogger Game Clone

## Project
This is a project using HTML, CSS, Javascript to create an old school Atari frogger-like game.

## Instructions
You begin the game with 5 lives. Your objective is to accumulate as many points as possible. 
In order to score points or get extra live:
- **Grab a Star** and reach the water without getting hit by minions to add **100 points**.  
- **Grab a Heart** and reach the water without getting hit by minions to add **1 live**.  
 *You will not be allow to enter the waters without holding either a star or heart.*

## Controls
- Move the player with the keyboard keys: **up**/**down**/**left**/**right** **↑↓←→** arrow keys.
- Be sure to turn up volume for music & sound effects which makes it a little less boring. :smirk:

## Tips
To get infinite lives, pickup the heart on every round and you can pretty much last forever.
