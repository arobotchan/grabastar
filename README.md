You begin the game with 5 lives. Obviously, your objective is to accumlate as many points as possible. 
In order to score points or get extra live:
**Grab a Star** and reach the water without getting hit by minions to add **100 points**.  
**Grab a Heart** and reach the water without getting hit by minions to add **1 live**.  
 *You will not be allow to enter the waters without grabbing either a star or heart.*

## Controls
- You can move the player with the keyboard keys: **up ↑**/**down ↓**/**left ←**/**right →** arrow keys.
- Be sure to turn up your volume for music & sound effects which makes it a little more exciting. :smirk:
